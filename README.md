# SampleDocumentCreator

an alarmingly simple app to create sample office documents. Because I often seem to need some sample content to use. It reads the first x chars of a random wikipedia article and saves it as an office document.

## Params
0. folder path for output. A folder created there with todays date to put the outputted files in
1. the number of files to create
